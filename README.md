## Anodized TSX

> ! Still in development until version 1.1 (Meaning any 1.0.* variants won't be production safe!)

Want to use TSX syntax on your controllers with zero overhead and an infinitesimally lower amount of dependencies? Anodized's TSX module is very small, has 0 dependencies (other than typescript, but anodized is based on typescript).
